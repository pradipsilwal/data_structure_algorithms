# Singly Linked List: Golang

This program is the implementation of Singly Linked List using Golang. The following operations associated with singly linked list is implemented.

1. Adding a node
2. Deleting a node
3. Traversing the list
3. Searching the list

## Adding a Node 

There are 4 types of addition in the list.

1. Add node to the empty list
2. Add node at the head 
3. Add node at the tail
4. Add node in between head and tail

## Deleting a Node

The deleteion implemented in this list is deleting the node by the position. We can also delete the node by value. Here, the position of the node that is to be deleted is provided to delete the node. There are 3 types of deletion:

1. Delete the head node
2. Delete the tail node
3. Delete node between head and tail

## Traversing 

This operation is traversing each node in the list and displaying its content. 

## Searching 

The we can also search for the node by passing the value to be searched. The given implementation only searches for the values for the single first match. If there are multiple same values in the list, this search only returns the first matching value.
